## What is this website?

thushaveiheard.com is a collection of Tibetan beliefs, superstitions and sayings. Many of posts published here are from published works, which in-turn are from oral sources. Eventhough Tibetans do not necessarily believe or follow these beliefs, superstitions and sayings nowadays, however they continue to play role in the day to day lives.

Eventhough it is fun and amusing to read these age old sayings, however to follow them or not is completely upto you.
