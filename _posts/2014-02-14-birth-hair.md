It is common custom that some time after a child is born al its hairs are cut off. The cut-off hair is called the ‘birth-hair’, considered to be rather unclean and impeding to the natural growth of the hairs. This cutting is believed to ensure a good growth later on, and is commonly done after the child attains one year in age.
