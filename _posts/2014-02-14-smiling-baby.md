If an infant smiles on meeting a person for the first time, it is believed that the person will live long. “You are auspicious, and may you also live long,” an older Tibetan would respond when a baby smiles on meeting him or her. On the other hand, if the baby cries or makes unpleasant facial expressions, the person will have a short life or else encounter difficult days ahead.
