An infant is never or rarely taken out of the house at night, to prevent evil spirits and other malignant beings from causing it sickness and cursing it. As well, they want to protect the child from seeing anything frightening in the dark, things that adults cannot see but they can. If the baby must be taken out, soot from the hearth is put on its nose and chest. This is drawn upward in a dark line, using the third finger.
