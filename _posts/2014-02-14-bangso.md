When a child is born, a purification ceremony is performed. If it is a boy, this takes place on the third day after birth, and on the fourth day for a girl. In some parts of Tibet this difference is not observed. The ceremony is performed to free baby from the impurity of the delivery. until this has been performed, people avoid visiting the house. In any case, the family would not allow anyone in, because they believe that the entire atmosphere within the ouse has been polluted by the delivery. After the purification ceremony is done in the morning, neighbors, friends and relatives arrive with presents to celebrate the birth and welcome the baby to the world[^1]. This ceremony is called bang-so. It involves a short religious ceremony and the burning of incense, the all-purifying material, and the common Tibetan method of cleaning indivisible dirt. The mother washes her face and hair (in warm water) and puts on clean clothes.

[^1]Footnote: Buddhism considers this human realm as the most fortunate realm. Tibetans call it the 'Precious Human Birth' not because we can think and enjoy all the comforts, but because in this life/birth we can accumulate enough merit and attain Buddhahood.
